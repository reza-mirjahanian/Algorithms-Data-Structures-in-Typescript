// The topological sort algorithm takes a directed graph and returns an array of the nodes where each node appears before all the nodes it points to.
//
//     The ordering of the nodes in the array is called a topological ordering.
// cyclic graphs don't have valid topological orderings.

// We can modify DFS to find Topological Sorting of a graph. In DFS, we start from a vertex, we first print it and then recursively call DFS for its adjacent vertices. In topological sorting, we use a temporary stack. We donâ€™t print the vertex immediately, we first recursively call topological sorting for all its adjacent vertices, then push it to a stack. Finally, print contents of the stack. Note that a vertex is pushed to stack only when all of its adjacent vertices (and their adjacent vertices and so on) are already in the stack.
